## 80s DJ

I started my DJ career in the 80s and have remained a true vinyl enthusiast ever since. I bought my turntables and records brand new back in the day, and they still serve me well today. You can catch me playing my signature sound at [The Buccaneer](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mSdJa4LBF-DmX84ABx1XzQ?select=Lhsn2xlrPQveHq1VRn7Ldg) from time to time, as well as at private events.

If you're looking for a DJ who has stood the test of time, look no further than me. I bring a unique energy to every set I play, drawing on a vast collection of records. Whether you're looking for 80s hip-hop, funk, soul, or disco, I've got you covered. For a sample of my songs I typically play, take a look at my Spotify playlists below.

If you want to book me as your vinyl turntable DJ for your next event, just [get in touch](mailto:andy@kumeda.com). I'm always happy to share my passion for music with others and create an unforgettable experience for everyone involved.
