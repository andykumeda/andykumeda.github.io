                <p>The Enneagram is a model of human personality that divides people into nine different types based on their core beliefs, fears, and motivations. These types are represented by a geometric figure called an enneagram, which shows how the different types are interconnected and how they relate to one another. The Enneagram is often used as a tool for personal and spiritual development, as it can help people understand their own personality and how it affects their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.</p>
                <p>The Enneagram is a complexed and nuanced personality typing system that consist of nine different types, and it can be a useful tool for personal growth and development. According to the Enneagram, each person has a specific personality type, which is determined by the way they see and interact with the world. The nine types are represented by the points on the Enneagram symbol, which is a circle with nine points arranged in a specific pattern. There are also 2 lines that connects to each type and they connect with two other types - one line connects to the type during health (Direction of Integration/Growth), and the other line connects to the type when one is under pressure (Direction of Disintegration/Stress).</p>
                <p><img src="/assets/img/enneagram.jpg" alt="Enneagram" /></p>
                <p>In addition to the nine main Enneagram types, the system also includes "subtypes" and "wings." The subtypes are variations within each Enneagram type that are determined by an individual's dominant instincts (for self-preservation, social interaction, or sexual attraction). The wings are the two adjacent Enneagram types that are most closely related to an individual's dominant type, and they can influence an individual's behavior and thought processes.</p>
